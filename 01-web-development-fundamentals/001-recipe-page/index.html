          <h2>Preparation method:</h2>
          <p>
            In a blender, beat the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar and
            chocolate powder until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, add the flour and
            baking powder and mix with a spoon. Pour into cupcake liners lined
            with paper liners and place in a large baking dish, one next to the
            other. Bake in a preheated medium oven for 25 minutes or until
            golden brown. Remove and let cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the filling, heat all the ingredients over medium heat, stirring
            well until thickened. Turn off the heat, let cool and place in a
            piping bag with a pearl tip. Set aside. Place the whipped cream in a
            piping bag with a star tip and set aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            To assemble, make a hole in the center of the cupcakes and fill with
            the reserved coffee brigadeiro. Decorate the surfaces of the
            cupcakes with the reserved whipped cream, making circles. Decorate
            with coffee beans and refrigerate until serving.
